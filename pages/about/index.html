    <h1 data-load="move">Hi, I'm Braden.</h1>

    <p data-load="move">
        I'm the designer
        that creates unique visual brands
        for protestant churches
        in the midwest. These are churches
        who want to represent a clear, unified mission
        in an age of brokenness and disunity.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and studied communications and graphic design. I'm currently in Oklahoma City working for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org" target="_blank">Oklahoma Baptists</a> and living my dreams of creating art, playing drums, and occasionally riding BMX.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!</p>
