    <h1 data-load="move">Hi, I'm Braden.</h1>

    <p data-load="move">
        I help midwestern churches plan and execute digital outreach strategies.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">
        These are churches who want to boldly represent a clear, unified mission in a culture of brokenness and disunity.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and studied communications and graphic design. I'm currently in Oklahoma City doing design for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org" target="_blank">Oklahoma Baptists</a> and living my dreams of creating art, playing drums, and occasionally riding BMX.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!</p>
