    <p data-load="move">
        I help devs learn design.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">
        I started off as a graphic designer, learned to code, and realized how hard it is to keep up with the demands of the web. DIY websites have never been more prolific, and the bar for visual excellence, animations, and interactivity is rising higher every day.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">
        I've curated <a href="/blog">my blog</a> to give you a toolkit of design concepts that will set your projects apart and double the value you can offer to clients.
    </p>

    <h4 data-load="move">The personal stuff</h4>
    <p data-load="move">
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and studied communications in college. I graduated, got married, and now I'm in Oklahoma City living my dreams of building cool stuff, playing drums, and riding bmx.
    </p>

    <p data-load="move">I'm always looking to meet new people, so I'd love to hear from you!</p>
