        I help motivated developers learn design.
    </p>
    <p data-load="move">
        I started off as a graphic designer, won some awards, and now I use code to build stuff, specifically websites and apps. I'm always looking to meet new people, so I'd love to hear from you!
    </p>

    <h4 data-load="move">The personal stuff</h4>
    <p data-load="move">
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. I graduated, got married, and now I'm in Oklahoma City living my dreams of building cool stuff, playing drums, and riding bmx.
