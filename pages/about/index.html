    <h3>The personal stuff</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. While I was there, I started noticing the business side to the creative fields I was interested in. That deepened the appeal of design for me - it added the thrill of seeing tangible results from intentional work.
        <br>
        About that time, I began dating my wife, who continues to help me keep things in perspective.
        <br>
        For the last year, I've been learning to code, improve my storytelling, and practicing design at every opportunity.
