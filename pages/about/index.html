    <p>
        I'm an award-winning visual designer working in-house for a large Oklahoma nonprofit. I'm always looking to expand my connections in the industry, so I'd love to hear from you!

        <li>This is a <a href="https://designstarterapp.netlify.com/" target="_blank">design starter toolkit</a> that uses API's from Google, Unsplash, and the open-source community to save designers time on their projects!</li>

    <h3>The personal stuff</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. While I was there, I started noticing the business side to the creative fields I was interested in. That deepened the appeal of design for me - it added the thrill of seeing tangible results from intentional work.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the last year, I've been learning to code, improve my storytelling, and practicing design at every opportunity.
