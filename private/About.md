## Hi, I'm Braden.

I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and studied communications and graphic design. I'm currently in Oklahoma City doing design for [Oklahoma Baptists](https://www.oklahomabaptists.org) and living my dreams of creating art, playing drums, and occasionally riding BMX.

I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!
