# The Logo Manifesto
## 2019/07/29
### design, branding

This manifesto is to get me into the headspace for designing innovative, fully realized logo marks.

 - The job of a logo is to identify, not explain.
 - A logo doesn’t have to have a wordmark.
 - A logo doesn’t have to have an icon.
 - A logo can be static or dynamic.
 - A good logo burns 0 calories to look at.
 - Every logo is a little bit of a copy.
 - A good logo feels familiar before it feels original.
 - A logo can be informative or iconic, but not both.
