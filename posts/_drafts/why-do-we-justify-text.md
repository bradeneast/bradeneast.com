Type is everywhere, and if you're anything like me, it's hard to tell the difference between good and bad uses of typography. it’s important to ask the question: “How do I make layouts easy to read?”

If you trace the English language back through the course of its development, you’ll find some very exciting and important pieces of information.

Our modern day alphabet was developed from Latin.  Latin was used by the Roman people, who adapted it from the Greeks, who got their alphabet from the Phonecians.

During those thousands of years, writing was a much more experimental area than it was now.

Rongorongo is a form of boustrophedonic writing that was found on Easter Island in the 1800’s.  It reads starting at the bottom left, and becoming inverted every other line, in this pattern:

right-to-left, upside-down

and so on

Writing/reading direction also impacts our perception of time, space, and abstraction skills.  Nearly all first-world countries are left-to-right cultures.
