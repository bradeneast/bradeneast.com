                    I'm an award-winning visual designer working in-house for a large Oklahoma nonprofit. I specialize in identity design, but I've recently started offering brand strategy for those who want to make an even bigger splash. I'm always looking to grow my clientele, so I'd love to hear from you if you think we might be a good fit.

                <p>
                    Every day I'm falling more in love with Jesus, my wife, and my craft. By day I work a 9 to 5 &ndash; by night I explore abandoned places, climb things, and solve puzzles.
