            <description>When I write for this blog, I usually embed a CodePen at the end of the post, as a proof-of-concept of sorts. The problem is, embedded pens are not as friendly and easy to use as most other CodePen features.</description>

            <description>Im sometimes lazy when it comes to accessibility on web projects. No matter how hard I try, Im usually adding aria-label and tabindex and role attributes later than Id like.</description>

            <description>Im a proponent of styles in CSS over styles in Javascript where at all possible. That said, sometimes we want to add a little bit of extra zest that requires JS.
