My name is Braden East. Since 2016, I've been designing marketing and brand materials, helping like-minded businesses and churches reach their communities. In this way, I want to make fast, high quality design available to every Bartian, one encounter at a time.

Recently, I've seen the signs of a recent trend: **outsourcing**. Cutting costs is on the mind of every business owner, and farming out creative work to an impersonal, foreign service seems like an easy way to do that.

Here's the problem: My clients have told me it's hard to communicate with these outside freelancers, and the results are falling short of their expectations. It turns out that a designer lightyears removed from your community can't produce powerful, personalized results that resonate with your customers.

As an alternative, I want to offer services that are local, reliable, and fast.

## My strategy is down to earth, but my results are out of this world.

How my model of service works:

- Individually priced projects. You'll never be billed for time.
- Deadline-friendly pace: I work faster than most design agencies.
- Jargon-free vocabulary. You'll experience a unique collaborative approach that takes "designer-speak" out of the equation.
- Quality-checks and review at every step. Each element of the project is carefully crafted and delivered for review in a shareable format.

I pride myself in tailoring each project to your unique needs. If you want to work with an agency at arms length, this might not be a good fit.
