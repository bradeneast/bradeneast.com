[Coarse](//coarse.netlify.app) is a totally design agnostic, minimal carousel library for modern websites.

{{ comp.video({ src:"coarse/basic.mp4" }) }}

Coarse supports swiping gestures on mobile devices, and uses performance optimizations like [event bubbling](//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/bubbles) to stay fast and responsive.

{{ comp.video({ src:"coarse/swiping.mp4" }) }}

It allows for total style control, custom transitions with pure CSS, and is highly configurable from the ground up.
