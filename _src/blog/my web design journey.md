I was finishing my last year of university when I decided to pursue marketing and design as a career. I bet you didn't expect a web design post to start off this way, but this is how it happened.

I had done some logos, thumbnails, and t-shirts for personal projects and friends. This seemed like an easy win! My confidence was at an all-time high. I knew that if I could just put my work out there for the world to see, people would be lining up to hire me.

Little did I know, there was a lot more to the world of graphic design than knowing how to use Adobe products. My ignorance was blissful and sweet!

To get my "stunning talent" out into the world, I believed that the critical piece I was missing was a portfolio website. Oh to be a rookie again...

Of course, being a designer, I was going to make my website itself a work of art, like the Guggenheim or the Louvre: A work of architectural and artistic mastery housing works of renowned art and captivating artifacts within its halls. The packaging needed to be a memorable experience all on its own.

I still muse at how I conceived of my work as worthy art and my web design skills as being up to the task. That kind of ambition and irrational self-belief is something I wish I could get back now.

Signing up for a Squarespace account was easy, and I got started. I was spending hours every day working on, thinking about, and even dreaming about this website. Long story short, what I created was a disaster. The layout was buggy. The copy was cringe. The interactions were confusing.

I had begun to realize how difficult websites were to design and maintain. I wasn't thrilled with how my website turned out, but I was still proud of it. Then a new acquaintance from church absolutely crushed my dreams.

My wife and I had been invited to a small gathering in someone's home for dinner and fellowship. I was introduced to a guy who ran a web design agency, so we started talking about different platforms, coding languages, and web design trends. The conversation was pushing the outer limits of my knowledge and experience, but I needed this guy's approval.

He quickly asked to see my website. I had to show it to him. So, I told him the URL. He pulled out his phone and typed it in.

> I think you should just use a template.

He was greeted by a broken layout and a confusing headline. He couldn't tell what the website was supposed to be, or what he was supposed to do. "I think you should just use a template."

That was when I realized how bad my "masterpiece" really was. It hurt, but it was the tough love I needed, and that comment changed the way I approached web design. I had been trying to reinvent the wheel so I could call it my own.

I finally accepted that you don't get bonus points for building things from scratch. It might feel good, but it usually takes too much time to be practical, and it's probably not as good as something else that's already out there. This paradigm-shift ultimately landed me my first salaried job as a web designer a few years later.

Today, when I build websites for clients, I start with a [solid foundation](https://www.elegantthemes.com/black-friday-2024/){ rel=nofollow } that is functional, flexible, and extremely reliable. Instead of starting from a totally blank canvas, I rely on conventions (albeit slowly and begrudgingly). Building on the best practices and hard work created by giants of design and web has almost always been the right solution to every problem I've encountered, no matter how specific.
