I'm Braden.

# I must become less and less.

I currently live in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, working as part of the creative team at a nonprofit called Voice of the Martyrs.

Since 2015, I've been designing logos for local Oklahoma businesses. While learning design, I began accumulating complementary skills in technology, especially those related to the web. Along the way I started fusing these skills together for uncommonly good results.

In past roles I've been involved in everything from designing web experiences to nationwide marketing campaigns. My best work revolves around [graphic design](/design), but I sprinkle in a little [coding](/code) every now and then.

Email me and I'll make myself available for a call or a coffee run.
