Scripture teaches that apart from God's intervention, we are as “dry bones”
(Ezekiel 37), and there is nothing we can do to earn God's grace.

This retreat was themed "Dead is Dead" with a teaching and study centered around
three words: "_**Pray, Live, Speak.**_"

The skull is a universal symbol of death, which is smiling to show how we
delight in our folly and sin apart from God. The texture of ocean waves
represents how our spiritual bankruptcy has left us dead at the bottom of the
ocean, beneath the waves, with no desire to be made alive or rescued.
