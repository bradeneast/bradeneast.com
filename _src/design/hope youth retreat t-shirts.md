Even though we are “dry bones” (Ezekiel 37), the unregenerate man tries to
appear spiritually alive in order to acheive the glory of God and earn his
grace.

The skull is a universal symbol of death, which is smiling to show how we
delight in our folly and sin apart from God. The texture of ocean waves
represents how our spiritual bankruptcy has left us dead at the bottom of the
ocean, beneath the waves, with no desire to be made alive or rescued.
