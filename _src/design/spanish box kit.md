## Objective

This project was intended to provide Hispanic pastors in Latin America with a beautiful and useful gift of appreciation for their ministry. In order to make this gift extra special, the stakeholders wanted a premium look and feel. The intent was that recipients would keep the box for a long time, maybe even put it on display in their home or office.

## Project details

The designed elements of the ministry kit included:
- A large containing box with a magnetic lid
- A greeting letter
- Two small boxes for USB sticks
- The USB sticks themselves

## Unique challenges

For security reasons, I couldn't put the organization's logo on the outside of the box. To make up for this I "branded" the box with uniquely VOM photography, showing the diversity of Christ's church around the world. The refined, circular border style calls back to special gift pieces we have produced for English-speaking audiences.

To raise this box above the rest, I suggested a foil treatment for the decorative borders on the front of the package. This was ultimately nixed due to budget constraints.

Another challenge to overcome was that our vendor was based overseas, so things like samples and wet proofs took up to three weeks.

## Outcome

In the first quarter of 2023, roughly 30,000 boxes will be distributed to Hispanic pastors throughout Latin America, beginning in Mexico City. One recipient said, "The kit is very beautiful. Opening it was exciting over and over again."
