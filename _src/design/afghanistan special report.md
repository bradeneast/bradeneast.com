## Objective

The Voice of the Martyrs works in the worlds most difficult mission fields, but ome nations are almost impossible to access for Christians outside the borders. At this moment in history, Afghanistan is one such nation.

My goal was to design a package for mailing that illustrated what the written stories described: cold isolation and looming danger for Christians inside the country.

## Project details

This was a multi-piece mailer comprised of:
- 4-color coated no.10 envelope with an address window
- 17x11 uncoated report
- 8 1/2x11 uncoated response device
- Single-color no.9 business reply envelope


## Unique challenges

VOM's visual language relies heavily on photography, aiming to bring readers into fellowship with their persecuted brothers and sisters in Christ. The media archive they maintain has over 1 million assets. However, the situation in Afghanistan made many of the photos in VOM's archive unsafe to publish. For approval to publish such photos, it takes between 1-2 weeks to get word from workers in the field.

> At the end of the day, there was only **one** safe-to-use photo of actual Aghan Christians.

## Solutions

By this point we were behind schedule, with only one medium-resolution photo available to use. I turned to representative photos not necessarily from Afghanistan. Finally, as a last resort, I pulled the final few images from stock resources like Unsplash.

I designed the report with photos, color, and layout choices which demonstrated how Christians are undeterred by the grim reality of Taliban control.

## Outcome

The final design of the special report was enthusiastically approved by organizational leadership in July 2022. At this point, I began working with our team and vendor to print and produce the mailing. In October, it arrived in over 700,000 mailboxes across the US and internationally, bringing widespread awareness of God's work in Afghanistan to the larger body of Christ.

I also participated in an art-direction role to guide the design of [a landing page](//vom.org/2022-10-afghanistan), the digital version of this report. This helped additional readers experience the printed report within a web context.
