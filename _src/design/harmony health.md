Harmony Health is a direct primary care practice in Newcastle, Oklahoma. Their
brand messaging is summed up in their tagline: “Optimal health comes from harmony of body, mind, and spirit.”

I selected Inter, a modern, trustworthy typeface befitting of this small
business. Some letterforms were tweaked to make the mark slightly more
approachable for moms with an affinity for natural remedies.

By analyzing business goals and customer demographics, I was able to arrive at a
logo identity which complements the Harmony Health message. Throughout the
discovery process, music and sound emerged as the dominant theme.

Although Harmony Health doesn't specialize in music therapy, the logo needed to
include a musical element.

## Outcome

In the end, Harmony Health, Direct Primary Care was able to successfully launch
with an identity that serves well in their primarily digital contexts. The final
mark is confident, bold, and balanced, showing that direct healthcare helps to
harmonize every aspect of patient well-being.
