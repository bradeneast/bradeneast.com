## Objective

In recent years, Christians in Africa have faced a rise in violence and
persecution from Islamic extremist groups. Militant groups have gone to great
lengths in attempts to stamp out church activities and evangelism in Africa. The
stories of these believers needed to be shared with the global Church.

Through the report's design, I wanted to show the energy and fervor with which
Christianity is resisting and overcoming persecution in Africa.

## Project details

This was a multi-piece mailing package comprised of:

- 4-Color Envelope
- 17x11 Report
- 8.5x11 Tri-Fold Response Device
- Business Reply Envelope

## Unique challenges

After final approval in September 2022, I started collaborating with our print
vendor. Although the proofs looked good, I requested a second set of color
proofs to make absolutely sure the natural color tones in the photography were
dialed in. As part of this process, I used a color-calibrated monitor and
proofing lightbox to make subtle tweaks for accuracy in the final product.

I also participated in an art-direction role to guide the design of
[a landing page](//vom.org/2022-12-africa), the digital version of this report.
This helped additional readers experience the printed report within a web
context.

## Outcome

The final design of the special report was enthusiastically approved by
organizational leadership in September 2022. At this point, I began working with
our team and vendor to print and produce the mailing. In December, this report
was mailed to roughly 500,000 recipients all over the world, showing how African
Christians are standing firm in the face of Islamic extremism.
