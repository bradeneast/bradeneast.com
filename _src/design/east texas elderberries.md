## Goals

The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with production.

> East Texas Elderberries expressed that they never wanted to lose sight of their orientation toward *family*.

As I discovered more about this elderberry farm, it became clear that family and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the operation. That gave me a starting point, from which I looked to design something timeless, approachable, and durable.

## From billboards to browsers

This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, I designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting online. To help with that, I designed a set of icons to supplement content on their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention of potential customers.

## Social media 

This was an important place for East Texas Elderberries to put their best foot forward. On-brand ads were a must-have for catching the eyes of their target market. So, I got to work.

## Outcomes

In the end, I helped East Texas Elderberries establish a brand identity that works in every area they needed. They are a family business that is well-equipped to look attractive and trustworthy for many generations to come.
