East Texas Elderberries is the elderberry farm that produces organically grown
products for crafty moms and resourceful businesses who want to buy local and
keep their families and customers healthy.

As we discovered more about this elderberry farm, it became clear that family
and generational legacy were the heartbeat of the operation. That gave us a
starting point, from which we looked to design something timeless, approachable,
and durable.

The target market for East Texas Elderberries is families or businesses that
want to create their own syrup or elderberry products. They sell elderberries in
a frozen or dehydrated form and wanted a brand that could scale rapidly with
production.

This identity needed to adapt fluidly for every application. To solve this, we
designed logo alternates, which would work at different scales: from as large as
a billboard design to as small as a browser favicon.

Social media was an important place for East Texas Elderberries to put their
best foot forward. On-brand ads were a must-have for catching the eyes of their
target market. So, we got to work.

East Texas Elderberries wanted a way to reinforce their brand while interacting
online. To help with that, we designed a set of icons to supplement content on
their website. These icons were a great visual aid to catch and hold attention
of potential customers.

In the end, we helped East Texas Elderberries establish a brand identity that
works in every area they needed. They are a family business that is
well-equipped to look attractive and trustworthy for many generations to come.
