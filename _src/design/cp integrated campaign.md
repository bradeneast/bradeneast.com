The [Cooperative Program](//sbc.net/cp) is the plan through which Southern Baptist churches give to support their state conventions and the Southern Baptist Convention. In 2021, the [Oklahoma Baptist Convention](//oklahomabaptists.org) launched a promotional campaign to bring awareness of the Cooperative Program's mission and ministry into Oklahoma Baptist churches.

## Why market the Cooperative Program?
Despite its prevalance and widespread effects, many Oklahoma Baptists either have never heard of the Cooperative Program, or have heard of it but don't know how it works.
