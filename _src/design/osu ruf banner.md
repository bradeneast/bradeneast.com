Reformed University Fellowships (RUF) are found on college campuses throughout the U.S., bringing students together for biblical teaching, authentic community, and rich discipleship.

The goal of this project was to help welcome students into the RUF space at Oklahoma State University. The room alone, while set up for worship and teaching, didn't distinguish itself as the meeting location.

RUFs have used various forms of branding and visual language depending on which campus you visit and who the director is. That said, there was a relatively consistent use of this graphic shown at the top of the design.

For the OSU RUF in particular, symbolizing abstract concepts like community, worship, and discipleship posed a significant challenge. There is no one way to go about designing such a banner.
