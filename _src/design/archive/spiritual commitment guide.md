Falls Creek is the largest youth camp in Oklahoma, with more than 50,000 students in attendance each summer. It exists to help churches reach lost students in their communities and to raise up a generation of godly, evangelistic teenagers.

During each night's worship service, there is an invitation for students to act on a calling they may have from God, and the Oklahoma Baptist convention had written ***a Spiritual Commitment Guide*** to help them process their calling in a biblical way.

  <p class="light-text">Members of the decision team for previous Falls Creek years had expressed that the guide's design made it difficult to use and unclear in some areas.</p>

I stepped up to the task of designing a new layout for the guide from scratch, giving it a clear structure and using design principles to help the decision team lead with discernment.

In 2021, Falls Creek saw over 2,600+ professions of faith, 1,500+ recommitments, and 500+ calls to ministry. For each of those students, the Spiritual Commitment Guide was present and offering biblical context to help them discern God's call on their lives.
