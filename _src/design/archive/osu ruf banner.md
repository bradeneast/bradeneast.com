Reformed University Fellowships (RUF) are found on college campuses throughout
the U.S., bringing students together for biblical teaching, authentic community,
and rich discipleship.

The goal of this project was to help welcome students into the RUF space at
Oklahoma State University. The room alone, while set up for worship and
teaching, didn't distinguish itself as the meeting location. For the OSU RUF in
particular, symbolizing abstract concepts like community, worship, and
discipleship posed a significant challenge. There is no one way to go about
designing such a banner.

RUFs have used various forms of branding and visual language depending on which
campus you visit and who the director is. That said, there was a relatively
consistent use of this graphic shown at the top of the design.
