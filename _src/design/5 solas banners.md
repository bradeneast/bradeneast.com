## Purpose

This set of five banners was designed as a part of Reformation Sunday on October
31, 2021. They creatively display the "Five Solas", that were resolved by the
protestant Christian reformers in the 16th century.

<!-- ## Sola Fide

The Roman Catholic church taught that the person cooperating with grace has an
inherent righteousness. One can lose this state through mortal sin. According to
the reformers, by faith alone our sin is imputed to Christ and His righteousness
is imputed to us.

## Sola Gratia

The reformers and St. Augustine before them argued that we are not saved by
pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. Our salvation is an act of pure grace,
and grace alone, on the part of God.

## Solus Christus

This dispute in the reformation was not the person of Christ, but the work of
Christ. Rome taught that grace was mediated to people through an elaborate
system of priests and works. Christ alone, and not the church, is our only
Mediator (WLC 181).

## Soli Deo Gloria

Soli Deo Gloria is central to the other four solas. It is first an attribute of
god, and is manifested in all things past, present, and future. The cheif end of
man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever (WSC 1). -->
