This set of five banners was designed as a part of Reformation Sunday on October 31, 2021. They creatively display the "Five Solas", that were resolved by the protestant Christian reformers in the 16th century.

## Soli Deo Gloria
Soli Deo Gloria is central to the other four solas. It is first an attribute of god, and is manifested in all things past, present, and future. The cheif end of man is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever (WSC 1).

## Sola Fide
The Roman Catholic church taught that the person cooperating with grace has an inherent righteousness. One can lose this state through mortal sin. According to the reformers, by faith alone our sin is imputed to Christ and His righteousness is imputed to us.

## Sola Gratia
The reformers and St. Augustine before them argued that we are not saved by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. Our salvation is an act of pure grace, and grace alone, on the part of God.

## Solus Christus
This dispute in the reformation was not the person of Christ, but the work of Christ. Rome taught that grace was mediated to people through an elaborate system of priests and works. Christ alone, and not the church, is our only Mediator (WLC 181).
