# Ditch the white board - A better tool for collaborating in a rebrand

Let's talk about how to get on the same page during the branding process. When we're personally invested in a project, as business owners and designers, we need a chance to look objectively at the challenges facing our brand.

Getting ideas into a visual format often reveals communication gaps and helps us get a handle on hard-to-explain ideas.

White boards are traditionally used for this process, but I'm working remote at least half the time. At in-person meetings, somebody is standing in front of the white board getting a blurry picture that will be emailed out later for everyone to decipher.  Worse yet, everyone has their own, different notes from the meeting, and may have interpreted the discussion completely differently. Nobody is on the same page, and you're back to square one.

Meetings in general are a headache, so when I have to attend one, I want it to be as painless as possible. I've found online collaboration tools to make my strategy sessions much more effecient and enjoyable for everyone.

The best tool I've found by far is [Taskade](https://www.taskade.com/u/bradeneast/recommend). For my meetings with clients, it is so important that we have a way to append the notes from a strategy session. Otherwise, things we might remember later are never addressed or get lost in a sea of email. I've used Google Docs before, but feels impersonal and messy. Taskade is list-oriented, which means there's more structure and organization to your notes from the get-go.

Because Taskade is just as accessible on my phone as in my browser, I find it extremely easy to add or modify notes when inspiration strikes. It all updates live, and collaborators will be notified about the changes.

On top of that, I can do things like
 - chat with clients in real time
 - do a live video call
 - schedule reminders and due dates for part or all of a project
 - categorize lists by tag
 - tag certain collaborators on a list item that needs their attention

The list goes on, but next time you're tempted to use a white board, consider a cloud-based tool. This post isn't sponsored by Taskade, I just prefer it to the other options like [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com) or [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com). Try them all and see what works for you.  Then, let me know what you use for client notes or strategy sessions and why you like it.
