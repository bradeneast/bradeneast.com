Let's talk about how to get on the same page during the branding process. As business owners, we need a chance to look objectively at the problems facing our company.

One of the most powerful ways we can form a bond with someone is when they speak our thoughts out loud. It gives us perspective, positions us to be objective, and makes us feel heard and understood.

Whether a nonprofit, small business, or large corporation, this step is critical in setting up a shared vision for everyone during the process of refreshing or creating a brand identity. We must be able to articulate the challenges we're facing before we can construct a solution.

Getting ideas into a visual format can reveal communication gaps and help us get a handle on hard-to-explain ideas. White boards are traditionally used for this process, but an online tool like <a href="https://www.taskade.com" target="_blank">Taskade</a> is much better. For my meetings with clients, it is so important that we have a way to append the notes from a strategy session. Otherwise, things we might remember later are never addressed or get lost in a sea of email.
