# The Logo Manifesto
## 2019/07/29
### graphic design, branding

This manifesto is to get me into the headspace for thinking outside the box and designing innovative, fully realized logo marks.

 - A logo can be static or dynamic.
 - The job of a logo is to identify not explain.
 - A logo doesn’t have to have a wordmark.
 - A logo doesn’t have to have an icon.
 - A good logo burns 0 calories to look at.
 - Every logo is a little bit of a copy.
