                <div class="body">In this article, we&apos;ll talk about how to build client trust, establish a strategic roadmap, and rely on visuals during strategy sessions. The church we&apos;re rebranding in this series is called &apos;Witness Church.&apos; Witness Church is a multi-site, nondenominational church with locations in major Italian cities. Right now, they&apos;re struggling to distinguish themselves from the many other well-known churches and cathedrals in Italy.<br>Let&#x2019;s try to help them develop a brand identity that will set them apart and help them acheive their goals for the next several decades.<br><h2>Giving our impression of the client&apos;s challenges.</h2>One of the most powerful ways we can form a bond with someone is when they speak our thoughts out loud. It gives us perspective, puts us in a position to be objective, and makes us feel heard and understood.<br>That&#x2019;s what we want to give to our branding client, Witness Church. Regardless of whether they are a nonprofit, small business, or large corporation, this step is critical in setting up a shared vision and understanding one another during the process of creating a good brand identity.<br>Let&#x2019;s articulate back to the client what we understand to be the challenges they&#x2019;re facing. We&#x2019;ll use as much illustration as possible because seeing an idea visually gets everyone on the same page. It also can reveal logical disconnects or hard-to-explain ideas (white boards are great for this, but paper or digital works too).<br>In this case, it might have turned out that we missed something during our session with the client. On top of wanting to send a clearer message of their identity to attract nonbelievers and evangelical Christians, Witness Church wants to specifically target people over the age of 35. They feel that it&#x2019;s unhealthy for a Church their size to be almost entirely young adults.<br>This is important, because it means our final solution can&#x2019;t exclude one generation or another. That would create a conflict between Witness Church&#x2019;s younger membership now and the more diverse age ranges in their desired future state.<br>Thanks for reading!
