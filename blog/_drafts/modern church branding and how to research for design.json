    "body": "Let's talk about how to research visual language when designing an identity system for a client. The church we're rebranding in this series is called 'Witness Church.' Witness Church is a multi-site, nondenominational church with locations in major Italian cities. Right now, they're struggling to distinguish themselves from the many other well-known churches and cathedrals in Italy.<br />Letâ€™s try to help them develop a brand identity that will set them apart and help them acheive their goals for the next several decades.<br />My last two articles have been about working with the client directly to understand their needs and get everyone on the same page. Now we're on a part of the project with less frequent communication. What happens in the reserach phase will determine when and how we present stylescape options to Witness Chuch at the next meeting.<h2>Don't rush the research phase.</h2>There's a lot riding on it, but this is always my favorite part of the process.  Along the way, we'll have to use our notes as a reference from the brand strategy session, where Witness Church emphasized church history, a focus on locals over tourists, and helping their members be driven evangelists.<br />After researching these goals and attributes, we should have some lists that look kind of like this... <ul><li>The Old Testament was written mostly in Hebrew.</li> <li>The New Testament was written mostly in Greek.</li> <li>The number 3 is a significant biblical number.</li> <li>The number 7 is also a significant biblical number.</li> </ul>This next list has a few discoveries about local marketing and branding... <ul><li></li></ul>The main purpose of the research phase is to help us get a handle on what Witness Church wants to convey in their visual identity.<br />"
