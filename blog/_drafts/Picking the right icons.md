If you've worked on a project involving sales copy, captioned images, or product descriptions, you've probably faced the challenge of picking an icon that helps communicate your message visually. Your icon pairings can make the difference between a lost customer and a quality lead.

Picking images that are too abstract will open your meaning up to interpretation, making readers work harder to understand your point and leaving room for confusion.

Picking images that are too complex or illustrative will distract users from the message. This can break up the flow of the story you're telling, and hurt conversion when users reach your call to action.
