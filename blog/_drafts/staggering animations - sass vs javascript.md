Fun fact of the day: your odds of winning an Academy Award are about 10 times better than your odds of experiencing an earthquake.  Don't give up on that film project!

Today, let's talk about integrating motion into our websites and user interfaces. Movement happening in perfect tandem seems unnatural to us. Our brains like smooth, sequential motion that overlaps, speeds up, and slows down according to the laws of physics.  That kind of motion is consistent with our experience and feels familiar.

In animation and motion design, a quick way to acheive this efferct is through *staggered*, or overlapping movement.
