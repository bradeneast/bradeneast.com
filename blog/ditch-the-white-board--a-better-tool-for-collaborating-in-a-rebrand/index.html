                <div class="body">Let&#x2019;s talk about how to get on the same page during the branding process. As business owners, we need a chance to look objectively at the problems facing our company.<br>One of the most powerful ways we can form a bond with someone is when they speak our thoughts out loud. It gives us perspective, positions us to be objective, and makes us feel heard and understood.<br>Whether a nonprofit, small business, or large corporation, this step is critical in setting up a shared vision for everyone during the process of refreshing or creating a brand identity. We must be able to articulate the challenges we&#x2019;re facing before we can construct a solution.<br>Getting ideas into a visual format can reveal communication gaps and help us get a handle on hard-to-explain ideas. White boards are traditionally used for this process, but an online tool like Taskade is much better. For my meetings with clients, it is so important that we have a way to append the notes from a strategy session. Otherwise, things we might remember later are never addressed or get lost in a sea of email.<br><br>Thanks for reading!
