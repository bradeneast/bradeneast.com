                    I'm an award-winning visual designer working in-house for a large Oklahoma nonprofit. I specialize in identity design, but I've recently started offering brand strategy for those who want to make an even bigger splash. I'm always looking to grow my clientele, so I'd love to hear from you if you think we might be a good fit.

                <p>
                    Every day I'm either designing a logo, coding this website, exploring an abandoned place. I got a communications degree, tried public relations, and then decided I'd rather be learning to code, write, and build long-lasting brands.

                    <li>Here's a <a href="https://designstarterapp.netlify.com/" target="_blank">fun web app I built</a> to help designers like me be a little more efficient.</li>
                    <li>Here's a <a href="https://ourparkour.netlify.com/" target="_blank">static site I created</a> with a custom nodejs build script.</li>

                    I'm more in love with Jesus, my wife, and my craft than I've ever been.
