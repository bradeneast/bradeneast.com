                <p>
                    I'm an award-winning visual designer working in-house for a large Oklahoma nonprofit. I specialize in identity design, but I've recently started doing brand strategy as well. I'm always looking to expand my clientele, so I'd love to hear from you if you think I'd be able to help you tell your story and grow your business.

                <h3>The personal stuff</h3>
                <p>
                    I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. While I was there, I started noticing the business side to the creative fields I was interested in. That deepened the appeal of design for me - it added the thrill of seeing tangible results from intentional work.
                    <br>
                    About that time, I began dating my wife, who continues to help me keep things in perspective.
                    <br>
                    For the last year, I've been learning to code, improve my storytelling, and practicing design at every opportunity.
