In 2019, the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma had an opportunity to align every subsidiary toward greater impact in the areas of church attendance, missions sending, baptisms, and giving. To this end, the question was asked:

> How can the work and mission of Oklahoma Baptists be distilled into a single, unifying mark?

## Why rebrand?

The core values of Oklahoma Baptists were defined in three Gospel-centered aspirations.

1. Encouraging Pastors
2. Embracing Brokenness
3. Making Disciples

With these goals in mind, I saturated each logo idea with a semblance of *statewide Gospel cooperation*.

  I took great care to make informed choices through each step of the design process, and my final concept was collectively refined by the whole creative group. The logo was affirmed by key executives and leadership within the organization.

## Identity System

To supplement the logo properly, I worked closely with our Creative Director to develop an identity system that would serve the diverse needs of Oklahoma Baptists. The Pantone-standardized colors were chosen to be functional and true to the Oklahoma Baptists brand messaging.

Each design guideline was especially tailored for clear and concise communication.

## Website

Until the rebrand, a strong online presence and smooth user experience were lacking for Oklahoma Baptists. Convention ministry websites were a core part of how churches stayed connected, but the user experience was found to be disjointed and fragmented.

> The consolidation of over 20 websites into one online home required elements like navigation labels, page structure, and layout to be tested with pastors and convention staff.

<p class="center">
  For the remaining &ldquo;free-standing&rdquo; websites, it was important that they reflect the texture and timbre of the Oklahoma Baptists brand.

## Collateral

Any departure from tradition needs a tactful and sensitive introduction. The nature of our audience meant that changes to the status quo could be ill-received, ***if not handled with special care***.

This challenge was addressed by evolving the look of print pieces early on, like prayer guides and event programs. By putting these items in the hands of Oklahoma Baptist churches, we were able to familiarize them with the look and feel of what was to come.

  Print collateral was initially produced with a limited color palette. This decision was made to emphasize the unity and clarity of Oklahoma Baptists brand despite its newness.

## Measuring Success

Despite the challenges of Oklahoma Baptists' diversity and aversion to change, the new identity was adopted quickly and well-received. Oklahoma Baptists are “Advancing the Gospel together”, so it was fitting that our mark communicated it all.

Since this project, Churches have continued to associate the new identity more and more with the ways their convention serves and amplifies the mission of Gospel advance.
