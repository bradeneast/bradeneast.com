360 Farms is the only business that makes start-to-finish elderberry products for people seeking value and quality. The goal was to reinforce their brand with those who desire improved well-being in an era of McDonaldâ€™s and WalMart.

360 Farms felt their previous brand identity was not striking a chord with customers, and did not represent their brand clearly. In this design project, family was an extremely important brand attribute. The land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family since 1947. This made it important to convey a sense of heritage and belonging.

The demand for elderberry products had increased in recent years, and 360 Farms' core demographic was shifting. Before designing their brand, we needed a checkup to help 360 Farms be as relevant as possible to their new customer base.

We discovered two core customer profiles to help ensure that the brand would resonate with as much of 360 Farms audience as possible. These profiles included Julia, a crunchy mom who is interested in organic, novel products, and Richard, a middle-aged man who wants an alternative to prescription drugs for health and longevity.

From elderflower soaps to elderberry wines, 360 Farms produces and sells it all. Because of this wide range of products, they had great need for a versatile logo that would work in any context.
