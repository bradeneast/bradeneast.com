In 2019, the Baptist General Convention of Oklahoma had an opportunity to seek a unified brand that looked and felt the same in every area of ministry and mission. In the process of brand discovery, the question was asked:

> How can the work and mission of Oklahoma Baptists be distilled into a single, unifying mark?

The core values of Oklahoma Baptists were defined in three Gospel-centered aspirations.

1. Encouraging Pastors
2. Embracing Brokenness
3. Making Disciples

With these goals in mind, the internal creative group focused on the concept of *statewide Gospel cooperation*.

To supplement the logo properly, I developed an identity system that would serve the diverse needs of Oklahoma Baptists. The Pantone-standardized color palette is curated to be functional and true to the Oklahoma Baptists brand messaging. Each standard is especially tailored for clear and concise communication.

The web is a core part of how churches maintain a relationship with their convention. For Oklahoma Baptists, a strong online presence and smooth user experience was a high priority.

Oklahoma Baptists are “Advancing the Gospel together”, so it was fitting that our mark communicated it all.
