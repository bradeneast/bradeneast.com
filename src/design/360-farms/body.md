360 Farms is the only business that makes start-to-finish elderberry products for people seeking value and quality. The goal was to reinforce their brand with those wanting improved health and well-being in an era of McDonaldâ€™s and WalMart.

The demand for elderberry products had increased in recent years, and 360 Farms' core demographic was shifting. They felt their brand was not striking a chord with customers. For 360 Farms, family was an extremely important brand attribute. The land on which the farm operated had been kept in the family since 1947. This made it important to start from a place of heritage and belonging.
