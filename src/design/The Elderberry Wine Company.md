We explored several color palettes throughout the design process. Each color indicates a specific wine in The Elderberry Wine Company's selection. The final palette accents a unique flavor and quality of each specialty blend.

The Elderberry Wine Company inherited the brand fonts of its parent company, [360 Farms](https://bradeneast.com/work/360-farms). Pairing [Bodoni* 11](https://indestructibletype.com/) with [Montserrat Semibold](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) offered a reliably elegant, modern way to communicate on wine labels, signage, and in digital designs.

The design element below the wordmark offered creative applications in patterns and on packaging. The illustrative icon ties the mark together and uniquely distinguishes The Elderberry Wine Company from competition.

The familiar colors, distinct seal, and bold design helped make the debut of The Elderberry Wine Company a huge success.
