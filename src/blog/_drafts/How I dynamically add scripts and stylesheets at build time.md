<meta name="categories" content="performance, static site">

I want to share a performance optimization I discovered today that I'm pretty happy with.

When you loaded this page, you downloaded a static HTML file with header, nav, sidebar, and footer already in place. The only thing that's dynamic is information you've provided about your preferred experience, like dark theme vs light theme. There's a [growing selection of static site generators](https://joshwcomeau.com/gatsby/a-static-future/) out there, so this should be pretty easy to acheive for most blog-style websites.
