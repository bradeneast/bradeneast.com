WRDS is a super-lightweight web app for fast, templated document creation. It lets you create PDF documents in seconds, save templates, export/import data, and write unlimited styles.

## Why build another word processor?
WRDS was built to solve the problems I encountered designing copy-centered PDFs like press-releases and guides. For me, programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign weren't quite right for quickly creating and modifying these types of documents. I felt like I was using an electric drill when I really needed a hammer.

So, I started coding WRDS to take advantage of the responsive, open-ended nature of the web and its browsers.

> Building this app from scratch has really broadened my practical knowledge of Javascript, but it's also given me a huge appreciation for how larger web apps handle edge-cases and extensibility.

My objective with this project was to use as few libraries as possible, and make something that was easy to scale as I continue to add new features.

Finally, WRDS is also privacy-first, meaning your data is never shared with a server. Everything is stored locally on your machine, giving you total control and privacy.
