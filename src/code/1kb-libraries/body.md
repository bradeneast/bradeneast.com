This is an ongoing project where I re-create popular Javascript libraries from scratch, making them smaller and simpler. So simple in fact, I've given myself a budget of ~1kb (minified and gzipped) for each library.

It started as I was looking for a markdown parser that wouldn't break the bank. The problem was, popular markdown parsers were pretty hefty (even minfied and gzipped, they still weighed 10kb-20kb). So, I wrote my own, but made it smaller and simpler. Surprisingly, it supports a ton of features!

> Creating these libraries from scratch has really broadened my practical knowledge of Javascript, but it's also given me a huge appreciation for how bigger libraries handle edge-cases and extensibility.

Next on my to-do list for this project is to write some formal documentation. If there's a library out there you think would be a good fit for this kind of thing, let me know (or better yet, try the exercise yourself).
