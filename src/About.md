## Hi, I'm Braden.

I'm 23. I've spent the last five years studying communication and design. I'm currently in Oklahoma City doing design for [Oklahoma Baptists](https://www.oklahomabaptists.org).  When I get a chance, I build websites, play drums, go hiking, and ride BMX. I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!
