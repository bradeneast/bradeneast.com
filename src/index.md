# I'm Braden, a user-<em>experienced</em> designer.

> I've spent the last five years in web technology and design. Most of that time has been working directly with the humans who use what I create.

I'm currently in Oklahoma City as part of the creative group for [Oklahoma Baptists](https://www.oklahomabaptists.org). When I get a chance, I code, play drums, go hiking, and ride BMX. I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!
