				<h2>How it started</h2>
				<p>
					About 5 years ago, my hobby grew into an identity design studio catering to <a href="/design">local Oklahoma businesses</a>. As I learned about design systems and patterns, I was thrilled about how they can be leveraged on the web.

				<h2>How it's going</h2>
				<p>
					I currently live in Oklahoma City, working as part of the creative group for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org/2020-vision/">Oklahoma Baptists</a> ‚õ™. I've played a role in many large projects, from designing web experiences to event themes. Along the way, I've learned uncommon skills like working with tricky software and picky printing houses.

				<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
				<p>
					My best work revolves around <span data-tooltip="Coming soon.">static sites</span>, <a href="https://codepen.io/bradeneast">CSS animation</a>, and <a href="/code/schwifty">front-end performance</a> üèÜ. I've explored a wide variety of Javascript toolings including React, Svelte, and Next.js, but prefer a framework-less approach.
