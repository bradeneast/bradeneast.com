I'm Braden.

# I must become less and less.

I currently live in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, working as part of the creative group for [Oklahoma Baptists](//oklahomabaptists.org/) ⛪.

<span data-tooltip="Probably more, but these things emerge over time.">Six years ago</span>, I was designing logos for [local Oklahoma businesses](/design). As I started learning more about design, I began learning complementary skills in technology, especially those related to the web. Along the way I started fusing these common skills with one another for uncommonly good results.

In my current role I've been involved in everything from designing [web experiences](//oklahomabaptists.org/2020-vision) to nationwide marketing campaigns. My best work revolves around [designing identities](/design/oklahoma-baptists), with a little [coding](/code) sprinkled in.

Email me and I'll make myself available for a quick call or a coffee run. [braden.east.design@gmail.com](mailto:braden.east.design@gmail.com)
