I'm Braden.

# I must become less and less.

I currently live in Oklahoma City, working as part of the creative group for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org/">Oklahoma Baptists</a> ⛪.

<span data-tooltip="Probably more, but these things emerge over time.">Six years ago</span>, I was designing logos for <a href="/design">local Oklahoma businesses</a>. As I started learning more about design, I began learning equally compelling skills in technology, especially those related to the web. Along the way I started fusing these common skills with one another for uncommonly good results.

In my current role I've contributed to many large projects, from designing [web experiences](https://oklahomabaptists.org/2020-vision) to nationwide marketing campaigns. My best work revolves around [designing identities](https://oklahomabaptists.org/styleguide), with a little [coding](/code) sprinkled in.

Email me and I'll make myself available for a quick call or a coffee run. [braden.east.design@gmail.com](mailto:braden.east.design@gmail.com)
