				<BlurbTitle>How I started</BlurbTitle>
				<BlurbDescription>
					About 5 years ago, my hobby grew into an identity design studio catering to <a href="/design">local Oklahoma businesses</a>. As I learned about design systems and patterns, I was thrilled about how they can be leveraged on the web.

				<BlurbTitle>What I'm working on</BlurbTitle>
				<BlurbDescription>
					My best work revolves around <span data-tooltip="Coming Soon!">static sites</span>, <a href="https://codepen.io/bradeneast">CSS animation</a>, and <a href="/code/schwifty">front-end performance</a> üèÜ. I've explored a wide variety of Javascript toolings including React, Svelte, and Next.js, but prefer a framework-less approach.

				<BlurbTitle>What I'm doing now</BlurbTitle>
				<BlurbDescription>
					I currently live in Oklahoma City, working as part of the creative group for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org/2020-vision/">Oklahoma Baptists</a> ‚õ™. I've played a role in many large projects, from web experiences to event themes.
					<br />
					Along the way, I've learned uncommon skills like working with tricky sowftware and picky printing houses.
