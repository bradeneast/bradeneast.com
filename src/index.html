		<h1>I'm Braden, a user-<em>experienced</em> designer.</h1>
		<blockquote>
			I've spent the last five years in web technology and design. Most of that time has been working directly with the humans who use what I create.

			I'm currently in Oklahoma City as part of the creative group for <a href="https://www.oklahomabaptists.org">Oklahoma Baptists</a>. When I get a chance, I code, play drums, go hiking, and ride BMX. I'd love to make a new friend - so DM or email me!
