    <h1>Hi, I'm Braden.</h1>
    <p>
        I help designers learn to code and developers learn design.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started off as a graphic designer, won some awards, and now I use code to build stuff, specifically websites and apps. I'm always looking to meet new people, so I'd love to hear from you!
    </p>

    <!-- <h4>Some of my recent projects</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Here's a <a href="https://pairiconsapp.netlify.com/" target="_blank">fun web app</a> I built for people who write better with a visual aid.</li>
        <li>This is a <a href="https://designstarterapp.netlify.com/" target="_blank">design starter toolkit</a> that uses API's from Google, Unsplash, and the open-source community to save designers time on their projects!</li>
        <li><a href="/blog">My blog</a> helps <component data-name="blog-audience"></component> blend design and code to create stellar interfaces.</li>
    </ul> -->

    <h4>The personal stuff</h4>
    <p>
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. I graduated, got married, and now I'm living in Oklahoma city living my dreams of building digital products, playing drums, and riding bmx.
