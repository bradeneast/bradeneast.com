    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I help businesses take control of their identity through holistic design.</p>

    <h3>Career things</h3>
    <p>
        I'm an award-winning visual designer working in-house for a large Oklahoma nonprofit. I'm always looking to expand my freelance clientele, so I'd love to hear from you if you're ready to let your brand's personality shine and grow your business.

    <h3>The personal stuff</h3>
    <p>
        I grew up in Bartlesville, Oklahoma and went to Oklahoma Baptist University for a communications degree. While I was there, I started noticing the business side to the creative fields I was interested in. That deepened the appeal of design for me - it added the thrill of seeing tangible results from intentional work.

    <p>
        For the last year, I've been learning to code, improve my storytelling, and practicing design at every opportunity.
